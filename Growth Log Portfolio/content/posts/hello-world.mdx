# Hello World - My First Learning Log

Welcome to my first learning log! In this post, I'll share my journey of setting up this portfolio website and the technologies I've learned along the way.

## The Stack

I decided to use the following technologies for this project:

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- MDX for content management

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of a React component I created:

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Increment
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## What I Learned

1. Setting up a Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configuring Tailwind CSS for styling
3. Implementing MDX for content management
4. Creating responsive layouts
5. Managing state in React components

## Next Steps

I'm planning to:

- Add more interactive features
- Implement a dark mode
- Add more learning logs
- Start live streaming my development process

Stay tuned for more updates!
